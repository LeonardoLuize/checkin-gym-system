### ☑️ About
---

<p>
  This repository is a personal project created to pratice and learn more about Test Driven Design (TDD) with Node.js. 
  The project uses Fastify, a popular web framework for Node.js, Prisma as a database ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) 
  and PostgreSQL as the underlying database engine.
</p>

<p>
  I have implemented three widely-used design patterns in software development: Test Driven Design (TDD), Factory, 
  and Repository. TDD has been a central focus of this project, allowing me to write automated tests before writing 
  any code and ensuring the reliability and maintainability of my application. Additionally, the Factory pattern has 
  enabled me to create objects efficiently and at scale, without worrying about the underlying details of their creation. 
  Lastly, I have utilized the Repository pattern to abstract the data access layer of my application, making it easier to 
  maintain and update over time. Together, the use of these design patterns has helped me build a reliable, efficient, and 
  scalable application that serves as a valuable reference for my future projects.
